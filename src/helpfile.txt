Adding a general description of the app would be nice and would pr
ovide a user with an idea of what can be expected, before they learn about the features.

step1:
input budget which should be number
input txt file path.
txt file content each line should be combined with product name and keywords,and seperate by ','
 such as: apple,1 kg,700g,kids
the processed user shopping list should be a dict:
{'Egg': ['700g', 'large'], 'Apple': ['1kg'], 'milk': ['2L']} 

step2:
wait program to produce data of product title which would be combined by product name and 
keywords provided in shopping list and relative random price,

this is to simulate the data which should be searched on realworld shopping website. 
the final data structure should be a list with dict:
[
    {'6.80': 'Egg 700g',
     '7.20': 'Egg large',
     },
    {'4.50': 'Apple 1kg',
     },
    {'5.3': 'milk 2L',}
]

step3:
program would produce all possible combinations according to the fake searching data,
and calculate the total price of each combination, then match with budget.
if budget is lower than the smallest total price, then ask user if they still want to see the results or quit.
if user want to continue, ask user if wanna save results in csv or just printed it.
the final combinations structure should be list with dict:
[ 
    {16.6: [['Egg 700g','6.80'],['Apple 1kg','4.50'],[ 'milk 2L','5.3']]},
    {17:[ ['Egg large','7.20'],['Apple 1kg','4.50'], ['milk 2L','5.3']]}
]
